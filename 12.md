We’ve got all of our front-end feeds set up for the blog now, which is most of the battle. Now, let’s focus on rendering a blog post itself.

## Creating our blog post layout

We need a layout to render a blog post for us. We’ve already covered how layouts work, so instead of going over that again, let’s get straight into it.

Create a new file in your `layouts` folder called `post.html` and add the following to it:

```njk
{% extends "layouts/base.html" %}

{% set pageHeaderTitle = title %}

{# Render post date and any tags that this post has been filed under #}
{% set pageHeaderSummary %}
	<time datetime="{{ date | w3DateFilter }}">{{ date | dateFilter }}</time>
	{% if tags %}
		<p class="visually-hidden" id="tags-desc">Tags that this post has been filed under.</p>
		<ul class="tags-list" aria-describedby="tags-desc">
			{% for tag in tags %}
				<li>
					<a href="/tag/{{ tag | slugify }}/">#{{ tag | title | replace(' ', '') }}</a>
				</li>
			{% endfor %}
		</ul>
	{% endif %}
{% endset %}

{% block content %}
	<article>
		{% include "partials/page-header.html" %}

		<div class="[ page-content ] [ flow wrapper ] [ flow-space-700 gap-top-700 ]">
			{{ content | safe }}
		</div>
	</article>

	{% include "partials/cta.html" %}
{% endblock %}
```

The stuff inside our `{% block content %}` block is pretty standard at this point, so let’s focus on the content we’re creating for our **page header**.

We have to set a `pageHeaderTitle` and, for this, we’re using our `title`. This takes the current post title, set in the page’s front matter.

For this instance of the page header, we’ve also defined `pageHeaderSummary`, and we’re using a cool feature of Nunjucks to do it. In Nunjucks, we usually set a variable like this: `{% set myVariable = 'value' %}`—and that’s exactly how we’ve set the `pageHeaderTitle` in this template.

You can also set a variable like this:

```njk
{% set myVariable %}
	I can put whatever <b>I like</b> in here.
{% endset %}
```

What this does is capture everything between `{% set %}` and `{% endset %}` and assign that to `myVariable`.

In the context of `pageHeaderSummary`, we’ve rendered some markup in our `{% set %}` block. This is because with a blog post, we want a bit of extra data in the page header, like posted date and tags.

The tags themselves are pretty straightforward: we take the `tags` from our front matter (remember, they’re an array) and we loop each one. Inside each iteration of the loop, we generate a list item with a link to that tag. Using the [replace filter from Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#replace), we create a Twitter-style hashtag as the label of the link. Using the [Eleventy slugify filter](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/filters/slugify/), we create a URL friendly version of the tag. This means that `Design Thinking` becomes `design-thinking`.

> [!TIP]
> There’s two accessibility things I want to bring to your attention here. With the hashtags, we’re using a capital case Nunjucks filter: [title](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#title). Where there are no spaces, like this, having a capital letter for each word means that some screen readers will announce each word separately.
>
> We also create an `aria-describedby` relationship with a `<p>` and the `<ul>` that houses the tags. This is to provide context to a screen reader user where the visual context might not be available. You can [read more about this ARIA role here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-describedby_attribute).

## Filters

> [!INFO]
> Previously, this course used the package `moment.js` to format dates used for the website. While it is still potentially an option, the [project is now considered legacy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment#project-status) and is no longer recommended for modern websites. It is a pretty large library and creates mutable objects which can lead to errors down the line if not handled properly. There are modern alternatives that are lighter and are able to create immutable objects. The package of choice is now Luxon as in addition to the aforementioned benefits, it is also built in to Eleventy.

We’re already using some in-built filters on this page, but it’s finally time to create our own. If you look in your terminal or visit <http://localhost:8080> now, you’ll see that your build of the site is currently broken. Let’s fix it!

In your terminal, stop Eleventy by pressing [[ctrl]] + [[c]]. Then, then in the terminal, enter the following:

```sh
mkdir src/filters
```

In your newly-added `filters` folder, create a file called `date-filter.js` and add the following to it:

```js
import { DateTime } from 'luxon';

export const dateFilter = (value) => {
	const ordinalDay = (day) => {
		return day > 0 //If day greater than 0, evaluate suffix. Else, return empty string
			? ['th', 'st', 'nd', 'rd'][
					//If day between 4-20 OR its remainder > 3, index = 0 (th). Else, remainder = index (1 = st, 2 = nd or 3 = rd)
					(day > 3 && day < 21) || day % 10 > 3 ? 0 : day % 10
				]
			: '';
	};

	const day = DateTime.fromISO(value, { zone: 'utc' }).day;

	return DateTime.fromISO(value, { zone: 'utc' }).toFormat(
		`d'${ordinalDay(day)} of' MMMM yyyy`,
	);
};
```

We’re using a package here called [Luxon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/luxon), which is a very useful package for working with JavaScript dates. Formatting dates with JavaScript is usually absolutely fine (as we’ll learn shortly). But because this JavaScript is only run at **build time** we can afford ourselves a developer experience treat, without making our users pay for it.

Luxon doesn't have a way to format numbered days ending in suffixes (st, nd, rd and th). So we'll need to do this ourselves which we have done by creating the function, `ordinalDay()`. It takes a passed numbered day and returns a suffix depending on the array index value it evaluates to: 0 = 'th', 1 = 'st', 2 = 'nd' and 3 = 'rd'.

To get this numbered day, we need to create a DateTime instance. DateTime is one of the most important classes when working with Luxon as it is used to represent our dates which we can use to convert into other formats. A DateTime represents a specific time and day consisting of a timestamp as well as a timezone. If no timezone is specified, it will use your system's timezone which is why we specify `{ zone: 'utc' }` when creating one. There are many ways you can create a DateTime and the one we use is `DateTime.fromISO()` as our date is already in ISO format. To extract the numbered day from our DateTime, we just need to append `.day`. To create our custom date format, we use `.toFormat()`.

Because we’ve added a package, run the following in your terminal:

```sh
npm install luxon
```

Now let’s add the other filter. Create another file in your `filters` folder called `w3-date-filter.js` and add the following to it:

```js
import { DateTime } from 'luxon';

export const w3DateFilter = (value) => {
	return DateTime.fromISO(value, { zone: 'utc' }).toString();
};
```

This one is straightforward. Because the HTML [`<time>` element](https://css-tricks.com/time-element/) accepts an ISO formatted date for the `datetime` attribute, all we need to do is append `.toString()` to format our DateTime.

The last thing we need to do with these filters is tell Eleventy about them. Open up `eleventy-from-scratch/.eleventy.js` and at the top of the file, add the following:

```js
// Filters
import { dateFilter } from './src/filters/date-filter.js';
import { w3DateFilter } from './src/filters/w3-date-filter.js';
```

That’s us importing the filters we just wrote. Now let’s link them up to Eleventy. While still in `eleventy.config.js`, just after the `export default function (eleventyConfig) {` bit, on around **line 8**, add the following:

```js
// Add filters
eleventyConfig.addFilter('dateFilter', dateFilter);
eleventyConfig.addFilter('w3DateFilter', w3DateFilter);
```

Now Eleventy knows about the filters, we can head back to our terminal and run `npm start`, which _should_ result in no errors. Happy days!

> [!TIP]
> In Eleventy, you can also add filters for specific templating languages. For example, we could add our filters **just** for Nunjucks like this:
>
> ```js
> // Add filters
> eleventyConfig.addNunjucksFilter('dateFilter', dateFilter);
> eleventyConfig.addNunjucksFilter('w3DateFilter', w3DateFilter);
> ```
>
> That’s not especially useful in our project, but if you have a couple of different templating languages running that need to be segregated, this can be a very handy feature indeed.

## Default layout and permalinks

We’ve got ourselves a fully functioning layout now, but we’re not linking it to our blog posts in front matter. You might think this is rather odd, but there’s a specific reason for it.

Eleventy lets us [assign data to **all content** in a folder](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-template-dir/). Our blog posts all live in `posts`, so inside there, we can set data in a `posts.json` file.

Create a new file in your `posts` folder called `posts.json` and add the following to it:

```json
{
	"layout": "layouts/post.html",
	"permalink": "/blog/{{ title | slugify }}/index.html"
}
```

This is called a directory data file. Inside it, we’re telling all items added to `posts` that they should use the `post.html` layout **unless they specify a different layout in their front matter**.

The second thing we’re doing is setting a permalink. Eleventy, by default, will use the filename and its directory to create a permalink. This means that, without our current setting, a post with a file name of `my-lovely-post.md` would have a permalink of `/posts/my-lovely-post/index.html`. We want all of our posts to live in the blog section though, so what we’re doing in the value for `permalink` is setting `/blog` as the root and then creating a slug from the post’s title.

Now, if you open your browser at <http://localhost:8080/blog/laws-of-ux/> it should look like this:

## Wrapping up

We’ve learned some real fundamentals here—especially building our own custom filters. This functionality is what really engaged me with Eleventy in the first place, after years of working with Jekyll, where such capability was problematic, to say the least.

In the next lesson, we’re going to improve our layout further by adding a “more posts” feed.
