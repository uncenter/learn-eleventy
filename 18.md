title: 'Lesson 18: Setting up Sass'
---

Before we get into this one: it is a pretty _intense_ lesson, so if you felt like you need a break already, now is the time to have one!

For this project’s CSS, we’re going to be using Sass. If you’ve never heard of it, you’ll find a really good summary on the [Sass home page](https://sass-lang.com/):

> Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

This is exactly how we’ll be using Sass to write our CSS—as an extension of the native language. The main reason **why** is that it makes working with the CSS methodology we’ll be using—called [CUBE CSS](https://piccalil.li/cube-css/)—much easier.

> [!TIP]
> Before we dig deep into the front-end, I strongly recommend that you read [my article on CUBE CSS](https://piccalil.li/blog/cube-css/).

> We will of course cover it well in this course, but understanding why we’re using Sass will be a lot easier when you understand CUBE CSS.

In order to work with Sass, we’re going to add a custom template language for Sass through Eleventy to convert our `.scss` files into `.css` files that the browser can parse and understand. This is called [preprocessing](https://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-1).

## Adding Sass as custom template language

The first thing we need to do is add a custom template language for Sass to the configuration in your `eleventy.config.js` file:

```js
eleventyConfig.addExtension('scss', {
	outputFileExtension: 'css',
	useLayouts: false,
	compile: async function (inputContent, inputPath) {
		let parsed = path.parse(inputPath);
		// Don’t compile file names that start with an underscore
		if (parsed.name.startsWith('_')) {
			return;
		}

		const compiled = sass.compileString(inputContent, {
			loadPaths: [parsed.dir || '.', this.config.dir.includes],
			silenceDeprecations: ['import', 'global-builtin', 'slash-div']
		});

		// Map dependencies for incremental builds
		this.addDependencies(inputPath, compiled.loadedUrls);

		return async (data) => {
			return compiled.css;
		};
	},
});

eleventyConfig.addTemplateFormats('scss');
```

> [!NOTE]
> You may have noticed that we configured our Sass compilation to ignore certain deprecation warnings with `silenceDeprecations`. These warnings tell us that certain Sass features will no longer work in future versions. The styling content of this course still relies on these features however, so we are ignoring them for now. Don't do this in the real world though! Make sure you are paying attention to deprecations and changes in the dependencies you use.

With `addExtension`, we register the `scss` file type and instruct Eleventy to use our `compile` function to process Sass files. In the `compile` function, we first ignore Sass [partials](https://sass-lang.com/guide/#partials) that begin with an `_` in the filename. Next, when we compile the result to a string, we make sure to load dependencies and partials in the same directory as the file being processed. Last but not least, we mark imported files as dependencies to Eleventy for incremental builds, and return a function that returns in the resulting CSS.

This uses two new dependencies, `sass` and Node.js's `path` module, which need to be imported at the top of the file, above `export default function (eleventyConfig) {`:

```js
import path from 'node:path';
import * as sass from 'sass';
```

Lastly for this section, we have a new dependency to install. In your terminal, run the following:

```sh
npm install sass@v1.97.1
```

## Critical CSS

There’s one CSS file that appears on **every page** as **critical CSS**. Let’s create that.

We need to create a folder for our styles, though, so inside `eleventy-from-scratch`, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
mkdir src/css
```

Now, in your new `css` folder, create a file called `critical.scss` and add the following to it:

```scss
@import 'reset';
```

Since we are going to be including our critical styles inline on our pages, we don't need them to be generated in the output directory. In your `css` folder, create a file called `css.11tydata.js` and add the following inside:

```js
export default {
	permalink: function (data) {
		// Don't write our critical included styles to the output directory
		const criticalStyles = ['critical', 'home', 'page', 'work-item'];
		if (criticalStyles.includes(data.page.fileSlug)) {
			return false;
		}
	},
};
```

Like our [directory data files](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-template-dir/) `work.json` for the `work/` collection and `posts.json` for the `posts/` collection, Eleventy will apply this [JavaScript Data File](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-js/) to the entire folder because `css.11tydata.js` and the `css/` parent folder share the same "file slug" (the `css` part before the file extensions).

In this case, our `css.11tydata.js` directory data file disables the `permalink` property for the hard-coded critical files, [telling Eleventy to skip writing these files to the output directory](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/permalinks/#skip-writing-to-the-file-system).

We need to create this file for `critical.scss` to import, so create a new file in the same folder called `_reset.scss` and add the following to it:

```scss
// A modified version of my "modern reset" https://github.com/Andy-set-studio/modern-css-reset

/* Box sizing rules */
*,
*::before,
*::after {
	box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* Remove default padding */
ul[class],
ol[class] {
	padding: 0;
}

/* Remove default margin */
body,
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
p,
ul[class],
ol[class],
figure,
blockquote,
dl,
dd {
	margin: 0;
}

/* Set core root defaults */
html {
	scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

/* Set core body defaults */
body {
	min-height: 100vh;
	text-rendering: optimizeSpeed;
	line-height: 1.5;
}

/* Remove list styles on ul, ol elements with a class attribute */
ul[class],
ol[class] {
	list-style: none;
}

/* A elements that don’t have a class get default styles */
a:not([class]) {
	text-decoration-skip-ink: auto;
}

/* Make images easier to work with */
img {
	max-width: 100%;
	display: block;
}

/* Inherit fonts for inputs and buttons */
input,
button,
textarea,
select {
	font: inherit;
}

/* Remove all animations and transitions for people that prefer not to see them */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
	* {
		animation-duration: 0.01s !important;
		animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
		transition-duration: 0.01s !important;
		scroll-behavior: auto !important;
	}
}
```

This is a slightly modified version of this CSS reset that I created. You can read about it in my article, [A modern CSS reset](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/a-modern-css-reset/).

> [!TIP]
> You might have noticed that the file is called `_reset.scss`, rather than `reset.scss`. This is because Sass will ignore files with a `_` prefix unless they are imported with `@import`.

## Getting the CSS on the page

We’ve got our Sass processing set up, but now we need to get some CSS on the page. Eleventy comes with the official [Render plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/render/) for rendering template files inside other templates, which we'll use to copy our compiled critical CSS into our layout.

Nothing to install here, but we'll need to import the plugin at the top of our `eleventy.config.js` configuration file:

```js
import { RenderPlugin } from "@11ty/eleventy";
```

Within the config function, below the line which added the RSS plugin, add the newly-imported render plugin:

```js
eleventyConfig.addPlugin(RenderPlugin);
```

Next, we’re going to add two snippets to the base layout, `base.html`. Open up `eleventy-from-scratch/src/_includes/layouts/base.html` and just before the closing `</head>`, at around **line 8**, add the following:

```njk
<style>{% renderFile "./src/css/critical.scss" %}</style>

{# Add facility for pages to declare an array of critical styles #}
{% if pageCriticalStyles %}
	{% for item in pageCriticalStyles %}
		<style>{% renderFile "./src/css/" + item %}</style>
	{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```

The first thing we do here is include our base critical CSS, which we’ve already discussed. The interesting bit comes after this, though.

In our actual page layouts, like `work-item.html`, we can declare `pageCriticalStyles` as an array. Inside that array, we can set paths to other critical stylesheets. We’ll demonstrate this later in the course, but what it allows us to do is break up our critical styles into smaller, more succinct pieces, which is great for performance.

Straight after this, in `eleventy-from-scratch/src/_includes/layouts/base.html`: add the following:

```njk
<link rel="stylesheet" media="print" href="/fonts/fonts.css?{{ assetHash }}" onload="this.media='all'" />

{# Add facility for pages to declare an array of stylesheet paths #}
{% if pageStylesheets %}
	{% for item in pageStylesheets %}
		<link rel="stylesheet" media="print" href="{{ ("./src/css/" + item) | inputPathToUrl }}?{{ assetHash }}" onload="this.media='all'" />
	{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```

These are our **non-critical** styles. None of these CSS files exist yet, but we’ll make them soon. We have a similar setup where a page can declare `pageStylesheets` which, again, we’ll be using soon.

The important thing to make a note of here is a little performance trick of setting the `<link/>`’s `media` attribute to "print". This tells the browser to still download the file, but deprioritize it, which means more important content loads first without being blocked (known as render blocking).

When the file has finished downloading, we have a _tiny_ bit of JavaScript that converts the `media` attribute to `all`, which then allows the browser to parse it. If this JavaScript didn’t run, the loaded CSS would only be parsed if the browser **printed something**.

I urge you to read [this post about it on the Filament Group Blog](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/async-css.html). It’s super smart!

## Asset hashing

Ok, last bit of this _long_ lesson. When we add all of this CSS to the page, we’re referencing `{{ assetHash }}` a lot. We need to define that.

Open up `eleventy-from-scratch/src/_includes/layouts/base.html` and add the following **right at the top of the file**:

```njk
{% set assetHash = global.random() %}
```

Then, create a new file called `global.js` in your `_data` folder and add the following to it:

```js
export default {
	random() {
		const segment = () => {
			return (((1 + Math.random()) * 0x10000) | 0).toString(16).substring(1);
		};
		return `${segment()}-${segment()}-${segment()}`;
	},
};
```

This does exactly what it says on the tin: it returns a random string. This helps to keep our asset cache fresh because every time Eleventy re-builds, it will be a unique value. This means that every time you deploy your site, you can guarantee that your users won’t have out of date CSS.

## Wrapping up

Holy moly, this was a big one, right? The good news is that our Sass is set up, so writing CSS for this project will now be a _joy_.

Let’s move straight on to the next part of our asset pipeline — fonts.
