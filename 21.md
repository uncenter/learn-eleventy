## Adding the transform

We’re going to use a handy Eleventy feature called [Transforms](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/#transforms). Transforms are a bit like filters where we take the input, pass it though the Transform and then get the transformed output back in return. The Eleventy Image plugin from [the last lesson](/lesson/20) itself uses Transforms under the hood, so we already know how powerful they can be.

We’re going to grab each page as it’s built and minify the HTML, **only** if we are in production mode. The reason why we only minify HTML in production mode is because this upcoming function is pretty heavy-duty, for understandable reasons, so it makes sense to only run it once per page.

Now, in our `eleventy.config.js` configuration file, start by importing the following import at the top:

```js
import htmlmin from 'html-minifier-next';
```

Above the start of the configuration function, add this variable declaration:

```js
const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
```

This is a flag we can use to tell if our build is running in production mode. To make this work, we'll need to add a new `production` script to run our build in production mode.

Open up `eleventy-from-scratch/package.json` and add the following line at the end of the `"scripts": {` block, on a new line **between lines 4 and 5**:

```json
"production": "NODE_ENV=production npm run build"
```

You'll need to add a comma at the end of the previous line, after `"build": "eleventy"`, for the JSON to be valid.

It should now look like this:

```json
"scripts": {
	"start": "eleventy --serve",
	"build": "eleventy",
	"production": "NODE_ENV=production npm run build"
},
```

Back in the configuration function, add the transform itself:

```js
if (isProduction) {
	eleventyConfig.addTransform('htmlmin', function (content) {
		if ((this.page.outputPath || '').endsWith('.html')) {
			return htmlmin.minify(content, {
				useShortDoctype: true,
				removeComments: true,
				collapseWhitespace: true,
			});
		}
		return content;
	});
}
```

We’re determining whether or not we’re in production mode, and adding our Transform if we are.

What the function does is first check each page to see if it’s an HTML file. If not, it returns it out, untouched. If it _is_ a HTML file, it runs it through a package called `html-minifier-next`, which gives us back some nice compressed HTML in return.

We’ve got a new package here, so let’s install it. In your terminal, run the following:

```sh
npm install html-minifier-next
```

That's it!

In your terminal, stop Eleventy by pressing [[ctrl]] + [[c]]. Then, run `npm run build`. Try inspecting the HTML in the output folder (`dist/`), or **view source** on <http://localhost:8080>.

Now, stop Eleventy again ([[ctrl]] + [[c]]), and this time run `npm run production`. This is the new script we added earlier, which sets the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `production` and triggers Eleventy to add our HTML minification transform. If you inspect or **view source** this time, you should see the HTML look very packed and much more condensed. Hooray!
