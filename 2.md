Now we have a better idea of what Eleventy is and have the tools we need to get started, let’s make something that we can see in the browser.

Next, we'll add one of the most important files for the project: the Eleventy configuration file.

Create a new file in your `eleventy-from-scratch` folder called `eleventy.config.js` and add the following to it:

```js
export default function (eleventyConfig) {
	eleventyConfig.setInputDirectory('src');
	eleventyConfig.setOutputDirectory('dist');
}
```

This is our [Eleventy config file](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/). It's the beating heart of your Eleventy site. It delegates and instructs everything that makes up the final output.

What we've just added is the core, most basic config. We have defined a default export, a function where the argument `eleventyConfig` provides access to Eleventy's configuration API. These settings tell Eleventy to look in the `src/` folder for our input content, templates and other source code, and tell it to use `dist/` as the output folder.

Remember: the output will be folders and HTML pages (at the moment).

## Adding some dependencies

We’ve chatted a lot about Eleventy so far, but still haven’t even installed it!

First, though, we need to get ourselves a `package.json` file. This contains metadata about the project and lets npm identify the project and handle its dependencies.

We'll create `package.json` in our `eleventy-from-scratch` folder and add the following to it:

```json
{
	"scripts": {
		"start": "eleventy --serve",
		"build": "eleventy"
	},
	"type": "module"
}
```

This `package.json` file does twofold; firstly, `"type": "module"` gives our package the module type so that Node knows to parse it as an [ES module](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#introduction). Secondly, the `start` and `build` scripts give us more convenient ways of running Eleventy (more on that in the next section).

Now that’s sorted, we can install Eleventy. In the terminal, run the following command:

```sh
npm install @11ty/eleventy@v3
```

We’ve installed the latest version of Eleventy locally in our project. Let’s make it do something!

## Hello, world

In your `eleventy-from-scratch/src` folder, add a new file called `index.md` and add the following to it:

```md
Hello, world
```

Yes, that’s pretty uneventful, but let’s now put Eleventy to work. Make sure you've saved your changes in your text editor. Then, in your terminal, in the `eleventy-from-scratch` folder, run the following command:

```sh
npx eleventy --serve
```

If you go to <http://localhost:8080> (the default port for Eleventy) in your browser, it should look like this:

![Hello, world in a Google Chrome browser window](/images/ss-hello-world.jpg)

Pretty cool, right?

> [!TIP]
> By running `npx` we use the local Eleventy dependency. You can also [use `npx` to run other packages, like Eleventy, locally](https://css-tricks.com/possibly-the-easiest-way-to-run-an-ssg/).
>
> The `--serve` flag in our terminal command instructs Eleventy to serve the `dist` folder with a local web server and also watch for any file changes. This means that if you change the content of `index.md` and refresh your browser: you should see the new content.

## Setting up our scripts

Running `npx eleventy --serve` in the terminal is easy enough, but it would be even easier to just run `npm start` instead. To do this, we use [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).

In our `package.json` file, we already added a line containing `"start": "npx eleventy --serve"`. Instead of writing out the command `npx eleventy --serve` in our terminal to run Eleventy each time, we can use this npm script to run `npm start` with the same effect.

> [!TIP]
> The `start` script is a special one. It’s a default script that npm will run if you just run `npm start` in the terminal. There are a few others, such as `restart`, `stop` and `test`. You can read more about them [in the npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).
>
> Any non-standard scripts you add to your `package.json` file can be run with `npm run` followed by the script name. For example, if you had a script called `build`, you could run it with `npm run build`.

Open your terminal again. Press [[ctrl]] + [[c]] at the same time to stop it, then run `npm start`. It should fire up that same “Hello, world” page at <http://localhost:8080>.

## Wrapping up

We’ve achieved a lot in this lesson. We’ve installed Eleventy and got it up and running in an npm script. We’ve also added our first piece of content to the site which will become our home page.

Next up: we’re going to start digging into HTML and Nunjucks, which will suddenly start to make things really interesting.
