A one liner in a markdown file isn’t all that useful, so let’s get some HTML on the page. We’re going to use [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) to do this.

## What is Nunjucks?

[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) is a templating language that’s powered by JavaScript. It’s a way of extending HTML that lets us add logic, loops and various other capabilities.

These allow our templates to be dynamic, even though at the end, they’ll generate static HTML. It’s sort of like Sass, but for HTML rather than CSS.

You can also use Nunjucks in the browser as a client-side templating language. It’s very powerful, as we’ll come to learn throughout the course.

## Getting started with Nunjucks

Eleventy already has Nunjucks built in, and if we were to use a `.njk` file, it would automatically use Nunjucks to process it. That’s super smart but, ideally, we want to be using good ol’ HTML pages.

Luckily, Eleventy has us covered for that. All we need to do is update our Eleventy config file.

Open up `eleventy-from-scratch/.eleventy.js` in your text editor.

Add the following 3 lines, straight after the `return {` statement:

```js
markdownTemplateEngine: 'njk',
dataTemplateEngine: 'njk',
htmlTemplateEngine: 'njk',
```

That whole block in your `.eleventy.js` file should now look like
this:

```js
return {
	markdownTemplateEngine: 'njk',
	dataTemplateEngine: 'njk',
	htmlTemplateEngine: 'njk',
	dir: {
		input: 'src',
		output: 'dist',
	},
};
```

With the code we’ve just added, we’re telling Eleventy that markdown files, data files and HTML files should be processed by Nunjucks. That means that we can now use `.html` files instead of having to use `.njk` files.

Now that’s set up, we’re ready to create some templates. Let’s start by making some folders for them to live in.

In your terminal, make sure you’re in the `eleventy-from-scratch` folder, and run the following command:

```sh
mkdir -p src/_includes/layouts
```

The `-p` flag tells the `mkdir` command to create any parent folders that don’t already exist.

This creates our `_includes` and `layouts` subfolders.

Inside `eleventy-from-scratch/src/_includes/layouts`, add a new file called `base.html` and open it up.

Paste in the following HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
		<title>{{ title }}</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		{% block content %}{% endblock %}
	</body>
</html>
```

This is our **base template**. All future templates will **extend** this template—more on that in just a minute.

But first let’s zoom in on two areas of interest in this snippet:

1. The `{{ title }}` part prints the yet to be defined `title` variable on the page. It’s a bit like a `${title}` in JavaScript, or the `<?php echo $title; ?>` in PHP. You can [read more about it](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#variables) in the Nunjucks docs.
2. The `{% block content %}{% endblock %}` area is really interesting. It essentially lets us create a named placeholder. If a template that extends `base.html` also puts content inside a `{% block content %}{% endblock %}`, it will render inside that block on `base.html`. This is _super_ handy for complex templates, because you can set as many `{% block %}` elements as you like.

> [!TIP]
> One handy thing we can do with a [Nunjucks block](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#block) is populate it with placeholder content while we’re working on our site.
>
> Imagine this example is in `base.html`:
>
> ```html
> {% block content %}
> <p>
> 	Here is some placeholder content that will render if a template doesn’t define a
> 	block.
> </p>
> {% endblock %}
> ```
>
> If say, `home.html`, which extends `base.html`, didn’t define its own `{% block content %}`, then the content above would render.
>
> This is _supremely_ useful for generating `<title>` elements—or anything else—if we’re still figuring out the content and we want to make sure there’s something in place in the meantime.

Now that we’ve set up our base template, let’s add a template for our home page.

Inside `eleventy-from-scratch/src/_includes/layouts` add a new file called `home.html` and add the following HTML to it:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
{% extends "layouts/base.html" %}
{% block content %}
<article>
	<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
	{{ content | safe }}
</article>
{% endblock %}
```

The first thing this does is tell our home template to extend the `base.html` template that we added earlier. Eleventy automatically looks for includes like these templates from the `_includes` directory, which is why we only need to specify `layouts/base.html`.

After this comes the `{% block %}` which we discussed earlier.

Inside the `{% block %}`, we’ve added an article which contains the title, followed by `{{ content | safe }}`. This will render the markdown content, which for us currently, is “Hello, world”.

Because it’s markdown, it will be now converted to HTML and this is where `safe` kicks in.

This is what’s called a [filter](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#filters)—a JavaScript function that can be applied to variables (in this case, `content`).

We have something called [autoescaping](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#autoescaping) turned on here, which protects us against cross-site scripting.

Without the `safe` filter, the HTML would be automatically _escaped_ to keep our site safe.

Adding the `safe` filter to our content marks it as safe and allows it to render on the page.

## Assigning our template to our page

_Right_, that was a lot to take in wasn’t it? Let’s reward that hard work with some output!

Open `eleventy-from-scratch/src/index.md` and delete everything in it.
Replace the deleted content with the following code block:

```yaml
---
title: 'Hello, world'
layout: 'layouts/home.html'
---
This is pretty _rad_, right?
```

Here, we're using YAML syntax to define some metadata for our page. The `title` field sets the title of the page to "Hello, world", while the `layout` field tells Eleventy to use `home.html` as the layout for this page. In this case, our `home.html` template is using `base.html` as its layout, so our final page will be fully composed with HTML.

Front matter is a way to add metadata to your pages and templates. It's typically used by static site generators to manage content. YAML is a human-readable, structured data format that's commonly used for configuration files. By enclosing our metadata in --- delimiters, we're telling Eleventy to treat it as front matter. You can read more about front matter in the [Eleventy docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-frontmatter/) or in the [next lesson](/lesson/4/)!

If you weren’t running it already, run `npm start` in your terminal. When you open <http://localhost:8080> now, you should see this:

![A browser with a page that has a title of “Hello, world” and a paragraph that says “This is pretty _rad_, right?”](/images/ss-home-initial.jpg)

## Wrapping up

We’re really getting somewhere now.

We’ve got ourselves a base layout, a home layout, _and_ we’ve been introduced to Nunjucks, Nunjucks filters and Nunjucks blocks.

This is all helping us render out some HTML. Nice work!

Next up, let’s dig a little further into front matter.
